# Countdown-timer-with-rotary-encoder-and-LCD-display

This project was made using STK600 Board with ATmega2560 AVR Microcontroller.
It configures  a processor timer1 so that it generates an interrupt after a defined time has elapsed. With this interrupt, the countdown time is to be measured and the LEDs are to be switched (flashing during the countdown).
The buttons are configured to set and reset the countdown time and start the timer. The LED assigned to a key should indicate each keystroke. The countdown time is set as follows:
• Pressing the sw0 button adds 1/4 second.
• Pressing the sw1 button adds 1 second.
• Pressing the sw2 button adds 10 seconds.
• Pressing the sw3 button resets the time to zero.

This Project was made using the Runtime library. This library is intended exclusively for use in the context of teaching. Any other use, especially of a commercial nature, is prohibited.
